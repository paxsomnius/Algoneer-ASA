# Algoneer-ASA

Welcome to the Algoneers GitHub Repo!

I created this before I had any clue on how one could actually make an ASA and it turned out to
be much easier coding wise than expected I had assumed it was like an ethereum smart-contract and would require a large amount of code
but Algorand is different the ability to create ASA's is hardcoded into its L1 protocol, which makes it alot easier to create an ASA
with a few commands and a node.

So with that being said I will use this repo to document the creation of Algoneer so it can act as a guide for future devs.

Will update once completed with a step by step detailed guide on how I securely managed this little project.

Main Points

Token is securely minted with air-gapped, multi-sig accounts, private node, No Ledgers
