# Algoneer-ASA

Welcome to the Algoneers GitHub Repo!

I created this before I had any clue on how one could actually make an ASA and it turned out to
be much easier coding wise than expected I had assumed it was like an ethereum smart-contract and would require a large amount of code
but Algorand is different the ability to create ASA's is hardcoded into its L1 protocol, which makes it alot easier to create an ASA
with a few commands and a node.

So with that being said I will use this repo to document the creation of Algoneer so it can act as a guide for future devs.

Will update once completed with a step by step detailed guide on how I securely managed this little project.

## Main Points

Token is securely minted with air-gapped, multi-sig accounts, private node, No Ledgers
Token was distributed manually, with goal commands and finally with an automated asset send python script using a private node and the algorand python sdk.

## Setting Up A Node

## Air Gapped Multi-sig accounts | Secure Minting of Algorand ASA's

## Python SDK | The Sandbox | Autoken.py

This project was a great introduction into blockchain programming and I have learned alot so much this project has morphed into a DAPP, check back here or the socials for updates.
